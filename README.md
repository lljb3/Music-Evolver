Kake Multimedia and ProdHMD's WordPress small theme for musicians.

Currently on version: 3.0.0!

## Before Installation

Please remember to only install Fusion Page Builder as it is compatible with Bootstrap 4.1. Bootstrap Shortcodes is not. Never install that again. There is also no need to comment any lines out anymore, as RequireJS is not included and there are no JS conflicts.

## After Installation
 
Please make sure to go thru every option in Theme Options in order to ensure a quality base template.

## Coming Soon To The Next Version:

N/A at this time.

## What's new in 3.0.0?

4. Added a theme option that turns on collapsed menus for desktop. Will open up a full screen menu once clicked.
